# PassportJS: **Local Strategy Explanation**
----------
***Passport JS*** is a kind of framework developed to wrap into a set of *middlewares*, the *authentication and authorization* processes, in order to abstract their logic and ease the access control to our app resources.

In ***Passport JS*** you can use over 500 *strategies*, which have been developed by different programmers around the world.

In this case, we will treat the **Local Strategy**, which is based in **sessions** and **basic credentials (username & password)**.
